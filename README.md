Not Exactly what you want?
--------------------------

Don't worry, you have options:

### Similar Templates

Curently none. But your own version is welcome here.

### Fork this / Create your own

If you have differences in your preferred setup, I encourage you to fork this
to create you own version. Or create your own; it does'nt strictly have to
be a fork.

* Once you have your own version working, add it to Similar Templates list
  above with a brief description.

* It's up to you wether or not to rename you fork/own version. Do watever
  you think sounds good.

### Submit a Pull Request

I also accept pull requests on this, if they're small, atomic and if they
make my own ansible experience better.
